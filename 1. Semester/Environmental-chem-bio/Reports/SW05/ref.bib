  abstract = {This chapter contains a review of the most recent uses of power ultrasound in the food industry. The potential use of this novel technology to produce permanent changes in the material is discussed with respect to liquid systems (by the production of intense cavitation) and gases (by the generation of high-intensity acoustic fields). Mechanical, chemical and biochemical effects produced by the propagation of high-intensity ultrasonic waves through the medium are detailed, as is the inactivation of microorganisms and enzymes for food preservation or decontamination. The increasing number of industrial processes that employ power ultrasound as a processing aid are described, including the mixing of materials; foam formation or destruction; agglomeration and precipitation of airborne powders; the improvement in efficiency of filtration, drying and extraction techniques in solid materials and the enhanced extraction of valuable compounds from vegetables and food products.},

   abstract = {Several methods have been developed in the literature which allow the maturity of composts to be assessed before it is used in agriculture. The objective of this study is to assess the maturity of the composts produced at the platform of the NGO ENPRO in Lomé on the growth and agronomic parameters of maize (Zea mays L., var. IKENE). To do so, three types of compost (gargabe, fruit waste, animal litter) were made for at least 3 months. The chemical analysis, phytotoxicity and agronomic tests carried out made it possible to assess the maturity of these composts. Indeed, the evolution of the C/N ratio, of the electrical conductivity, the phytotoxicity tests and the growth parameters of the composts show that the composts N°1 and N°2 are mature at the end of the 3rd month of composting while the compost N°3 can only be considered mature at the end of the 5th month of composting. But, with a yield of 2.39 ± 0.28 t/ha and a mass of 1000 grains of 346 ± 4 g, the treatment at 5 t/ha of compost N°3, has the best agronomic parameters compared to other types of compost and treatment without organic amendment. These results also show that compost with a high electrical conductivity has an inhibitory effect on the growth of corn plants (Zea mays L., var. IKENE). Basic chemical analysis, phytotoxicity tests and height growth of maize (Zea mays L., var. IKENE) are relatively efficient methods for evaluating the maturity of composts.},
