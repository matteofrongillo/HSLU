Fire (sun / light):
- PV system (no for domestic use);
- PV as design element, used as green façade;
- Lamps with new gases (too expensive and probably it wont work);

Water:
- Humidity detector;
- New pH scale (new litmus paper);
- Cl detector for pools;

Air:
- Tunnel chamber simulator with new functions;
- New fire extinguisher (+ fire);
- New air displacement detector

Earth (soil / green buildings):
- Geothermal product (+ water/glycol);
- Green façade with self-watering (+water);
- DSSC (+ sun);

Biosphere (Earth ??)
- No idea.

My main idea:
Nanoplastic detector paper ready-to-use.
