abstract = {The quest for green products and technologies for applications in the built environment has led to the birth of a new generation of sustainable materials, among which are mycelium-based composites. They are biocomposites derived from the growth of filamentous parts of fungus on an organic substrate. Their low carbon footprint, low energy and processing cost, biodegradability, and attractive range of properties, have made them highly demanded as alternative materials for use in the building and construction sector. Their bio-fabrication procedures, material properties, and prospects in building and construction applications have hardly been considered in a single review. It was noted that these composites have several potential benefits from economic, technical, environmental, and green credentials perspectives which make them desirable for building and construction purposes. However, their low mechanical properties, high water absorption, and lack of standardized development methods limit their applications to semi-structural and non-structural materials such as paneling, furniture, and decking. Future research should aim at reconciling its varying mechanical properties based on substrate, fungus species, growth condition, and processing method. Also, efforts should target improving its weathering and hydrophilic propensities, and scalability, factors that could undermine its long-term commercial success and applicability.}
