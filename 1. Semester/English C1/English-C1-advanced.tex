\section{Past tenses}

\subsection{Simple tenses}
\subsubsection{Past simple}
Past simple is used for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Finished past event at a specific past point in time. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Continuous tenses}
Are focused on ongoing actions at past or present time.

\subsubsection{Past continuous}
Past continuous is used to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Express something was ongoing at a specific past point;
    \item Focus on an ongoing action in the past that is ``crossed''
        by another past action.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Perfect tenses}
Most often an action stretching over time that started in the past
and continues either up until now (present perfect) or up until a
past point (past perfect)

\subsubsection{Past perfect simple}
Past perfect simple is used to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Express something happened before another past time;
    \item Compare two past events.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Perfect and continuous tenses}
\subsubsection{Past perfect continuous}
Past perfect continuous is used for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Past actions in progress up until another past point;
    \item Past actions in progress that are interrupted or unfinished.
\end{itemize}

\section{Passive forms}
Passive is used to say what happened to the subject.

Passive sentences are formed with ``to be'' in the appropriate tense
+ the past participle (+ed).

\subsection{Impersonal passive}
\subsubsection{Form}
When we use one of these verbs:

believe, claim, report, say, think, understand, know, consider,
estimate, expect, be rumoured, be reputed, allege;

we have to structure the sentence as follow:\\

\begin{flushleft}
    \begin{tabular}{|m{0cm}>{\centering\arraybackslash}m{1cm}|>{\centering\arraybackslash}m{4.5cm}|>{\centering\arraybackslash}m{6cm}|>{\centering\arraybackslash}m{2cm}|}
        \hline \rule{0pt}{15pt}
        & It + & \textbf{"be"} + (required tense) & \textbf{reporting verb} + (past participle) & that... \\ 
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{flushleft} \phantom{}

\begin{flushleft}
    \begin{tabular}{|>{\centering\arraybackslash}m{1.5cm}|>{\centering\arraybackslash}m{4cm}|>{\centering\arraybackslash}m{5.5cm}|>{\centering\arraybackslash}m{4cm}|}
        \hline
        subject + & \textbf{"be"} + (required tense) & \textbf{reporting verb} + (past participle) & main verb (to-infinitive $\rightarrow$ present or past) \\ 
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{flushleft}

\section{Linking words}

\section{Inversion}
After certain words and phrases the \textbf{word order is inverted}.
This kind of inversion is mainly found in formal speech and writing.

\subsection{Application of the inversion}
\subsubsection{Negation adverbs}
The negative adverbs \textbf{never (before/again), rarely, seldom,
barely/hardly/scarcely...when/before, no sooner...than, nowhere,
little (with a negative meaning)}.

\subsubsection{Negation}


\section{Formal letters}

\newpage
\section{Reported speech}
\subsection{Verb tenses}
We usually change the tense of the original verb so that it moves
further back in the past. We also change time expressions and pronouns
as necessary:

\textit{``We spoke to him yesterday'', they said.\tox
They said that they'd spoken to him the day before.}

We \textbf{do not} change the tense if the situation we are reporting still
exists and if the reporting verb is in the present tense:

\textit{``She's currently working in London'' \tox
He says she's currently working in London.}

\subsection{Modal verbs in reporting}
We usually change modal verbs in reported speech:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{will \tox would};
    \item \textbf{can \tox could};
    \item \textbf{may \tox might};
    \item \textbf{needn'n \tox didn't have to};
    \item \textbf{must \tox had to}.
\end{itemize}

We \textbf{do not} change modal verbs if the situation we are
reporting still exists and if the reporting verb is in the present
tense:

\textit{``We need to visit oue cousin'' \tox She says we need to
visit our cousin.}

Modal verbes are often reported using other verbs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item must, should, ought to \tox advised, urged;
    \item let's \tox suggested.
\end{itemize}

\textit{``You should ask for help'' \tox He advised me to ask for help.}

\subsection{Reported questions}
\subsubsection{Reported Yes/No questions}
When there is no question word in the direct speech question, we use
\textbf{if/whether}. The word order is the same as in the statement.
The verb tense and other changes are the same as for other types of
reported speech:

\textit{``Could I borrow your notes'' she asked \tox
She asked / wondered / wanted to know \textbf{if / whether she could
borrow} my notes.}

\subsubsection{Reported wh- questions}
The \textbf{wh-} word is followed by normal word order (subject + verb).
The verb tense and other changes are the same as for other types of
reported speech:

\textit{``Why did you leave that job?'' She asked him \tox
She asked \textbf{him why he had left} that job.}

\subsection{Summary reports}
We can use some reporting verbs to summarize what was said:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{``Don't come back -- or else'' \tox They \textbf{threatened} us};
    \item \textit{``It was me. I did it'' \tox He \textbf{confessed}}.
\end{enumerate}

Some verbs, such as \textbf{speak}, \textbf{tell} and \textbf{thank}, are only used in summary
reports, not with direct or indirect speech:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{She \textbf{spoke} briefly to reporters.}
    \item \textit{I \textbf{talked} to Kevin about the problem and he \textbf{thanked} me.}
\end{enumerate}

We can use reporting verbs such as \textbf{boast} or \textbf{lie} + \textbf{about}
to create a summary report:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{He \textbf{boasted about} his win};
    \item \textit{He \textbf{lied about} how he did it}.
\end{enumerate}

Other verbs used like this include: \textbf{complain, explain, inquire,
joke, protest, speak, write}.
