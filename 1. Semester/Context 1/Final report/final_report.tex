\section*{Abstract}
Festivals are significant cultural events but contribute to
substantial environmental challenges, particularly through waste
generated by abandoned, low-cost tents -often damaged and left behind.
These tents are often composed of synthetic materials that are
difficult to recycle or dispose of responsibly, exacerbating
ecological issues. 

This study explores the potential for designing a festival tent that
meets user requirements while addressing the environmental impact of
single-use camping gear.  

Through a value-benefit analysis, mycelium was identified as an
optimal material due to its biodegradability, recyclability, and
structural viability. The proposed design, the \myc,
aligns with circular economy principles, offering a fully recyclable
and predominantly biodegradable alternative to traditional festival
tents. 

Although experimental validation under simulated outdoor conditions
has not yet been conducted, the material is expected to exhibit
adequate water resistance and structural integrity for short-term use.
Future testing is required to confirm these properties and refine the
material for broader applications. 

The \myc\ represents a sustainable, cost-effective solution to
reduce festival waste and promote environmentally responsible
practices. It emphasizes the potential of mycelium-based materials in
advancing renewable and circular design solutions, underscoring the
need for further research and development in this field.

\section{Introduction}
The environmental challenges posed by global warming have driven society to adopt
increasingly eco-friendly practices. However, certain events, such as music festivals,
still leave a considerable environmental footprint. Festivals worldwide produce vast
amounts of waste, reaching up to 100 tons per day, with abandoned nylon tents being one
of the most persistent issue {\color{red}{(Gray reference??)}}. These tents, often made
from synthetic materials, are not easily recycled or biodegradable, contributing
significantly to plastic pollution that could otherwise be mitigated.

This report focuses on addressing this issue by introducing an innovative solution: a
fully recyclable and biodegradable tent made of mycelium. Mycelium, derived from fungal
root structures, provides an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional materials,
aligning with circular economy principles {\color{red}{(Attias reference??)}}. This project
aims to design a tent that meets user needs while reducing waste and improving disposal
options at the end of its life cycle.

This report presents this project in its developmental stages. Section 2 explores the
properties and potential of mycelium for this application. Section 3 outlines the
requirements and methodologies, including a morphological box and a value-benefit
analysis, used to determine the final design. The resulting product concept is detailed in
Section 4, followed by its validation and testing, discussed in Section 5. Lastly,
Section 6 concludes by evaluating the success of the project and identifying opportunities
for future improvements.


\newpage
\section{Background}

\newpage
\section{Development of concept}
This chapter describes the development of the concept of \myc.
The user scenario is presented at the beginning. From it, a catalogue
of requirements is made, and the result of this section is the
concept for the final product.

\subsection{User scenario}
This sub-section explains the primary use case of \myc\ and what describes the
problem it is going to solve. 

\subsubsection{Problem}
Many festival-goers buy cheap, disposable tents with the intent to use them only once.
These tents are often left behind after the event, as they are difficult to carry back,
especially if they are damaged. Because festivals can be rough on tents, people are
reluctant to bring high-quality ones and instead opt for cheap alternatives. As a result,
thousands of plastic and nylon tents are abandoned after major festivals, creating an
environmental issue with large amounts of non-biodegradable waste.

\subsubsection{Objective}
The \myc\ is a biodegradable and recyclable tent made from mushroom roots,
designed as an eco-friendly alternative to single-use plastic tents often abandoned at
festivals and outdoor events. Lightweight, easy to carry, and affordable, it provides a
durable yet temporary shelter that helps reduce plastic waste and minimize
environmental impact, offering festival-goers a sustainable way to enjoy their experience
without contributing to pollution.

\subsection{Requirements catalogue}
Based on the final user scenario and the feedback of potential customers, the
requirements have been defined in the catalogue of requirements (\autoref{tab:cat_of_req}).

\begin{table}[ht!]
    \centering
    \caption{Catalogue of requirements}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{media/req_cat_high_res.png}
    \label{tab:cat_of_req}
\end{table}

\subsection{Morphological box}
This chapter describes the process of developing three design variants for a
biodegradable festival tent using the morphological box method. The product was divided
into key subproblems, such as shape, size, structure support, lifespan, and material
processing. For each subproblem, a range of possible solutions was researched,
resulting in the initial morphological box (\autoref{sec:appendix}, \autoref{tab:initial_morph}).

To streamline the process, less critical subfunctions, like color design and
biodegradation duration, were excluded, and unsuitable materials, such as unprocessed
Mycelium-Based Composites (MBCs) and plastic, were removed. The refined
morphological box (\autoref{sec:appendix}, \autoref{tab:slimmed_morph}) formed the foundation
for selecting three promising design variants, which are detailed in \autoref{tab:morph_box}
and the following section. 

\begin{table}[ht!]
    \centering
    \caption{Morphological box with three solution variants}
    \includegraphics[width=.85\textwidth]{media/morph_box.png}
    \label{tab:morph_box}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Description of the three solution variants}
\pph{\color{newgreen}{Variant 1: Dome tent (Single use, Fully biodegradable)}}
The first variant is a dome-shaped tent, constructed entirely from biodegradable materials,
including mycelium poles and Mycelium-Based Leather (MBL). This variant is designed for
single-use and aims to provide the highest possible grade of biodegradability. It is produced
with a focus on low-cost and low-quality materials, suitable for short-term use at festivals.

\pph{\color{neworange}{Variant 2: Tunner tent (Four-person, Long-lasting)}}
The second variant is a tunnel tent, chosen for its optimal space-to-weight ratio, making it
suitable for accommodating four people—the largest capacity in this selection. It is designed
with higher-quality materials for a lifespan of one to three years, supported by an aluminum
structure for enhanced durability and stability.

\pph{\color{newblue}{Variant 3: Triangular prism tent (Two-person, Medium-lasting)}}
The third variant is a right triangular prism-shaped tent, designed for two people. This option
combines features from both the high-quality tunnel tent and the single-use dome tent. It
uses bamboo poles, which provide greater longevity than mycelium but are less durable
than aluminum, while still maintaining biodegradability.

The final selection between these three variants will be made in the following chapter.

\subsection{Value-Benefit analysis}
\autoref{tab:val-ben} presents the Value-Benefit analysis of the three previously described tent variants. In
alignment with our primary objective of addressing plastic waste at festivals, recyclability is
assigned the highest priority. The affordability of each variant is also crucial, as it must remain
competitive with existing products that contribute to the plastic waste problem. Given that
the target market is festival-goers seeking short-term, disposable solutions, the overall quality
and lifespan of the tents are less critical, as we do not aim to compete in the high-quality tent
market.

The analysis includes a row for ``Weather Resistance'', which evaluates the tent's ability to
endure adverse weather conditions, such as heavy winds. This aspect is particularly relevant
as different shapes provide varying levels of structural resilience.

\begin{table}[ht!]
    \centering
    \caption{Value-Benefit analysis}
    \includegraphics[width=.85\textwidth]{media/val-ben.png}
    \label{tab:val-ben}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Justified choice}
Based on the weighted ratings derived from the Value-Benefit analysis \autoref{tab:val-ben},
the Dome Tent variant emerges as the most suitable option, achieving a total score of 680
points, the highest among all variants. This reflects its strong alignment with customer
requirements, such as affordability, ease of use, and reduced environmental impact,
making it particularly appealing to festival-goers. Its features address key customer
needs for sustainable temporary shelter, while effectively contributing to the goal of
reducing plastic waste in festival environments.

\section{Final concept}
\label{sec:final_concept}
This chapter presents the finalized \myc\ design, detailing its structure, key features,
and components. It provides technical specifications based on the concept and includes plans
and diagrams for fabrication and assembly.

\subsection{Product concept}
This section presents an overview of the \myc, detailing its features with labeled
images of a simplified model that illustrates the structure and key components.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.85\textwidth]{media/side_view.png}
    \caption{Details side view}
    \label{fig:side_view}
\end{figure}

The main body of the tent is fully enclosed, extending up to the top, where an opening with a
protective mosquito net ensures constant air circulation. This ventilation opening is
safeguarded by a rain cover to prevent water ingress while allowing airflow. To maintain an
optimal space between the tent body and the rain cover, the tent poles are positioned
externally, supporting the rain cover above the body. This structure is depicted in \autoref{fig:side_view}

\newpage
\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.35\textwidth]{media/front_view.png}
    \caption{Details side view}
    \label{fig:front_view}
\end{figure}

Entry to the tent is facilitated by a secure loop-and-toggle system. Additionally, the door
features an overlapping design to prevent rain from entering the tent, as shown by the orange
line in \autoref{fig:front_view}. These specifications are based on the features layed out in the conception of
product 

\subsection{Technical specifications}
The technical specifications display the list of the main components such as size and material
in \autoref{tab:tech_spec}. These specifications are based on the features layed out in the conception of
product \autoref{sec:final_concept} and the morphological box. The scale for the prototype was set to 1:10.

The intention of the single use tent translates into biodegradable tent materials. However,
this criteria for the accessories shown in \autoref{tab:tech_spec} cannot be fulfilled at this stage of
development.

    \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\subsection{Construction plans}
The construction plans show in detail the shape and size of the tent. The final product
will be based on these technical plans, as well as its components will depend on them.
The tent consists of two main elements: the tent itself and the airtight cap.

The structure of the \myc\ is made of mycelium, as is the access door.
Its base measures (LxW) 185x185 cm, while the height from the base to the highest point (H)
is 140 cm as shown in \autoref{sec:appendix}, \autoref{pdf:tent-size} (Tent size).\\
It has a central circular hole on the highest part, which promotes optimal air exchange
and the passage of natural light.

Together with the circular hole, a fine mycelium perforated net is provided to supply
protection against all kinds of insects. It is also designed to facilitate night vision for starry
sky observers.

The airtight cap is also made of mycelium. Its main feature is that it is mountable at
any time and serves to prevent water or too much sun from entering the interior of the
tent. The cap is also raised to always ensure air exchange inside the tent.

The dimensions of the circular cap are \diameter 60cm, and circumference 188.5 cm
as shown in \autoref{sec:appendix}, \autoref{pdf:tent-size} (Tent size).
The cap is placed on the tent pegs and tied to them.

The \myc\ with the mounted cap measures (LxWxH) 185x185x\~150 cm.

\section{Mock-up}
The mock-up presentation is a key part of the project, allowing users to visualize and
understand the tent's design. The tent's features, including the removable cap and door
operation with the respective materials used to create the mock-up, will be shown below.

\subsection{Concept of mock-up}
The \myc\ mock-up features a fully enclosed body with an upper ventilation
opening, protected by a mosquito net and a rain cover.
External poles ensure airflow and prevent water ingress. The entry is secured with a
roll-and-button system, and the overlapping door design blocks rain (\autoref{fig:final_mockup}).
The mock-up has dimensions (LxWxH) 17.5x17.5x14 cm.

At the time the mock-up was created, the scale corresponded precisely to 1:10 of the final
tent, before the base of it was resized. The model, with the final version of the tent, is
not to scale, as can be seen at \autoref{sec:appendix}, \autoref{pdf:mockup-size} (Mockup size).

The final product will be constructed from mycelium, with a sample material displayed
alongside the mock-up (\autoref{fig:compact_myc}). Following the initial draft of the
mock-up, design adjustments were made to enhance the tent's shape and functionality. As a
basis, a simple construction plan is used to build and set-up the mock-up. Following
materials and sources are part of the mock-up:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cotton textiles for the rain cover and the main body;
    \item Bronze metal string for the framing;
    \item Mesh material as the mosquito net.
\end{itemize}

\section{Testing}
This chapter examines the testing phase, which is critical to ensuring that the product
meets technical specifications and fulfils customer requirements. The expected results
are then evaluated to give clarification, if further tests or development is necessary.

\subsection{Tests}
The testing process is divided into two principal areas: Verification and Validation.
For each area, three different tests will be conducted.

\subsubsection{Verification}
This subchapter discusses the verification process during the testing phase. The purpose of
this process is to ensure that the product has been developed correctly and meets the
predefined requirements.
Three of the most significant tests are outlined in \autoref{tab:verification}, with the
numbers in brackets indicating the corresponding links to the requirements catalogue (\autoref{tab:cat_of_req}).

\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}

    \hline
    \rowcolor[gray]{0.75}
    \textbf{Function} & \textbf{Requirement} & \textbf{Test procedure} & \textbf{Expected Result} \\
    \hline
    Hydrostatic head (1/12) & 
    The tent should have a minimum hydrostatic head of 1500 mm & 
    The hydrostatic head is determined by a water pressure test. The material is subjected to increasing water pressure. This continues until the material allows water to pass through. When the third drop has penetrated to the inside, the test ends. &
    The height of the water column at the point of water passage is above 1500 mm. $\mathbf{\Rightarrow}$\textcolor{newgreen}{\textbf{Fulfilled}} \\
    \hline
    Wind resistance (9) &
    The tent should be able to withstand a wind force of 50 km/h (Beaufort scale 6). &
    The tent is set up on a meadow and tested with a wind generator simulating a wind speed of 50 km/h for 30 minutes. Inside, it contains a sleeping bag, sleeping mat, and backpack with a total weight of 8 kg. The meadow has a minimum soil moisture of 40\%, reflecting conditions after rainfall. This worst-case scenario eliminates the need for additional tests, as drier conditions improve results. &
    The tent remains in place for half an hour. $\mathbf{\Rightarrow}$\textcolor{newgreen}{\textbf{Fulfilled}} \\
    \hline
    Air circulation (1) &
    It is not only the waterproofness that determines whether it stays dry inside the tent. The geometry of the tent must allow the humidity to be transported outside. &
    A humidifier is placed in the tent and switched on for 8 hours. It is set to release 50 ml of water per hour, which is roughly equivalent to a human being breathing. At the same time, the wind generator is set to 20 km/h to simulate a realistic wind situation on a large field. &
    No water collects on the tent floor after 8 hours: $\mathbf{\Rightarrow}$\textcolor{newgreen}{\textbf{Fulfilled}} \\
    \hline
    \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\newpage
\subsubsection{Validation}
This subchapter outlines the validation process, which involves three key tests
(\autoref{tab:validation}) to determine whether the correct product has been developed
and whether it fulfills customer requirements as specified in the requirements catalog. The
aspects evaluated include the operability, sustainability, and durability of the tent during a
festival. As all requirements are mandatory, each test must be successfully validated to ensure
compliance.

\begin{table}[ht!]
    \caption{Validation tests}
    \label{tab:validation}
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{2.5cm}|>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{3.5cm}|>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{6cm}|>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}X|}
    \hline
    \rowcolor[gray]{0.75}
    \textbf{Function} & \textbf{Requirement} & \textbf{Test procedure} & \textbf{Expected Result} \\
    \hline
    Operability (4/11) & 
    The set-up of the tent should be self-explanatory and fully constructed in 10 minutes. & 
    20 subjects aged between 18 and 35, who have no physical impairments and no previous experience of setting up tents, each get 10 minutes to completely set up the tent. The only aid they are given is a construction manual, with a visual and written demonstration of the set-up process. &
    All 20 subjects are expected to fully set up the tent within the given timeframe. $\mathbf{\Rightarrow}$\textcolor{newgreen}{\textbf{Fulfilled}} \\
    \hline
    Sustainability (7) &
    80\% of the mass of the tent should be recyclable. &
    The mass of the recyclable parts of the tent are added and compared to the tent’s complete mass to determine the percentage of the recyclable material. &
    Due to insufficient details on the density of mycelium-based leather only an assumption can be made. However, considering the fact, that the only non-recyclable components are the pegs, it is expected that more than 80\% of the total mass of the tent is recyclable. $\mathbf{\Rightarrow}$\textcolor{newgreen}{\textbf{Fulfilled}} \\
    \hline
    Durability during a Festival (1) &
    The tent should keep the customers and their belongings dry and clean. &
    During a five-day festival, the tent will be put to normal use by a subject in a simulation of the unexpected incidents or weather changes than can appear during a festival. The test will be conducted during a period, when rain is guaranteed. Therefore, if a festival concludes with no rainfall, the test shall be repeated at a different festival.

The use of the fully developed mycelium-based material is crucial for the tests outlined
in this subchapter discusses the verification process during the testing phase. The purpose
of this process is to ensure that the product has been developed correctly and meets the
predefined requirements.

Three of the most significant tests are outlined in \autoref{tab:verification}, with the numbers in brackets
indicating the corresponding links to the requirements . Therefore, these tests cannot be
conducted using a mock-up, as it does not accurately represent the properties and
behaviour of the material in its final form. Instead, they must be carried out using the first
prototype, which incorporates the fully developed material. This approach ensures that
the material performance, durability, and sustainability can be assessed in real-world
conditions, providing reliable data for further development and refinement of the
product.

\subsection{Discussion}
Regarding the verification tests, the primary source of uncertainty lies in the water resistance
of the material, particularly its water column. Existing materials with adequate water
resistance, such as alternatives to rubber seals, demonstrate that it is feasible to produce a
mycelium-based material with similar properties. However, further testing is required to
determine whether the material maintains its water resistance at very thin wall thicknesses,
which is crucial for meeting weight specifications.

Wind resistance is unlikely to pose a significant challenge due to the aerodynamic, wind-slip
shape of the tent. However, the ability to effectively manage moisture inside the tent remains
a concern. As this is a single-wall design, the construction and shape of the tent play a critical
role in facilitating ventilation. To address this, the ventilation opening has been enlarged
relative to the tent's total surface area. The effectiveness of this design will only become clear
during prototype testing.

Like the wind resistance, the validated operability and sustainability are unlikely to cause later
complications. This is due to the facts that the tent not only has a simple structure and a
construction manual as an available aid for the set-up process but is also made predominantly
out of a recyclable and biodegradable material. The overall durability of the tent during a
festival on the other hand could lead to further concern. Additional tests during extended
festivals with varying weather conditions will need to be performed to clarify how well the
tent can withstand longer and more challenging conditions.

\section{Conclusion}
The \myc\ project has sought to approach the critical environmental issue of waste
accumulation at festivals by developing a tent composed of a fully sustainable and recyclable
material. Mycelium, characterized by its high recyclability and cost-efficient cultivation, has
shown promise as a potential solution. However, a key challenge remains the evaluation of its
suitability as a tent material. Addressing this challenge requires extensive research and
development, which falls beyond the scope of this project.

Despite these challenges, the concept has demonstrated substantial potential. It responds
an urgent environmental problem and offers a compelling business opportunity, particularly
as a B2B solution for festival operators. Collaborations with such stakeholders could
significantly enhance the project's impact and feasibility.

Future work should prioritize comprehensive research into the material properties of
mycelium, followed by the production and evaluation of prototypes under realistic
conditions. This iterative development process will enable the refinement of the
product to ensure its functionality and durability. Given the significance of the problem
and the potential of the proposed solution, continuation of this project is strongly
recommended.
