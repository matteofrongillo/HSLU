Dear Petrushka,

% your course of studies
I am contacting you to share with you my scholastic background and my actual student life.\\
Since last year, I have been enrolled to the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences, in
the faculty of Energy and Environmental Systems Engineering. 

% your professional background: apprenticeships and/or internships, work experience 
My school experience started in Claro, a small village located at north of Bellinzona, the
capital of Canton Tessin. There, I have attended the kindergarten and the primary school,
whereas my secondary school took place in Castione.

Dithering about the choice to apply for a high school or an apprenticeship, I jumped into
the latter, starting my first job as a Building Services Designer. The job gave me the
choice to choose between three specializations: heating, ventilation, or plumbing systems,
and I stuck with heating systems. After a long meditation, I also decided to undergo
baccalaureate with the technical matura besides my four working years.

As soon as my apprenticeship ended, I served in the army, in the CBRN
(Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear) Decontamination Defence recruit school.
Although I did not enjoy the behavior of people in the military, I indeed loved my service.

Since the recruit school ended in November, instead of applying for a school, I decided to
convert my remaining days of military service into civil service.
I had the big opportunity to work six months as Research Collaborator in Renewable Energy,
in the University of Applied Sciences of Southern Switzerland, in the honorable Institute
of Applied Sustainability to the Built Environment, where I have learnt the theory and the
application of photovoltaics modules, finding the motivation to pursue further university
education.

% English language foundations including travel, studies and/or work (abroad)
%Although I have been following this three-year study program since the Fall semester started in
%2024, I have been officially accepted by the university only in my second semester,
%in May 2025, after a hard challenge the school required of me: to get a C1 certificate in
%English.
