\section{Past tenses}

\subsection{Simple tenses}
\subsubsection{Past simple}
Past simple is used for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Finished past event at a specific past point in time. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Continuous tenses}
Are focused on ongoing actions at past or present time.

\subsubsection{Past continuous}
Past continuous is used to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Express something was ongoing at a specific past point;
    \item Focus on an ongoing action in the past that is ``crossed''
        by another past action.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Perfect tenses}
Most often an action stretching over time that started in the past
and continues either up until now (present perfect) or up until a
past point (past perfect)

\subsubsection{Past perfect simple}
Past perfect simple is used to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Express something happened before another past time;
    \item Compare two past events.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Perfect and continuous tenses}
\subsubsection{Past perfect continuous}
Past perfect continuous is used for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Past actions in progress up until another past point;
    \item Past actions in progress that are interrupted or unfinished.
\end{itemize}

\section{Passive forms}
Passive is used to say what happened to the subject.

Passive sentences are formed with ``to be'' in the appropriate tense
+ the past participle (+ed).

\subsection{Impersonal passive}
\subsubsection{Form}
When we use one of these verbs:

believe, claim, report, say, think, understand, know, consider,
estimate, expect, be rumoured, be reputed, allege;

we have to structure the sentence as follow:\\

\begin{flushleft}
    \begin{tabular}{|m{0cm}>{\centering\arraybackslash}m{1cm}|>{\centering\arraybackslash}m{4.5cm}|>{\centering\arraybackslash}m{6cm}|>{\centering\arraybackslash}m{2cm}|}
        \hline \rule{0pt}{15pt}
        & It + & \textbf{"be"} + (required tense) & \textbf{reporting verb} + (past participle) & that... \\ 
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{flushleft} \phantom{}

\begin{flushleft}
    \begin{tabular}{|>{\centering\arraybackslash}m{1.5cm}|>{\centering\arraybackslash}m{4cm}|>{\centering\arraybackslash}m{5.5cm}|>{\centering\arraybackslash}m{4cm}|}
        \hline
        subject + & \textbf{"be"} + (required tense) & \textbf{reporting verb} + (past participle) & main verb (to-infinitive $\rightarrow$ present or past) \\ 
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{flushleft}

\section{Linking words}

\section{Inversion}
After certain words and phrases the \textbf{word order is inverted}.
This kind of inversion is mainly found in formal speech and writing.

\subsection{Application of the inversion}
\subsubsection{Negation adverbs}
The negative adverbs \textbf{never (before/again), rarely, seldom,
barely/hardly/scarcely...when/before, no sooner...than, nowhere,
little (with a negative meaning)}.

\subsubsection{Negation}


\section{Formal letters}

\newpage
\section{Reported speech}
\subsection{Verb tenses}
We usually change the tense of the original verb so that it moves
further back in the past. We also change time expressions and pronouns
as necessary:

\textit{``We spoke to him yesterday'', they said.\tox
They said that they'd spoken to him the day before.}

We \textbf{do not} change the tense if the situation we are reporting still
exists and if the reporting verb is in the present tense:

\textit{``She's currently working in London'' \tox
He says she's currently working in London.}

\subsection{Modal verbs in reporting}
We usually change modal verbs in reported speech:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{will \tox would};
    \item \textbf{can \tox could};
    \item \textbf{may \tox might};
    \item \textbf{needn'n \tox didn't have to};
    \item \textbf{must \tox had to}.
\end{itemize}

We \textbf{do not} change modal verbs if the situation we are
reporting still exists and if the reporting verb is in the present
tense:

\textit{``We need to visit oue cousin'' \tox She says we need to
visit our cousin.}

Modal verbes are often reported using other verbs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item must, should, ought to \tox advised, urged;
    \item let's \tox suggested.
\end{itemize}

\textit{``You should ask for help'' \tox He advised me to ask for help.}

\subsection{Reported questions}
\subsubsection{Reported Yes/No questions}
When there is no question word in the direct speech question, we use
\textbf{if/whether}. The word order is the same as in the statement.
The verb tense and other changes are the same as for other types of
reported speech:

\textit{``Could I borrow your notes'' she asked \tox
She asked / wondered / wanted to know \textbf{if / whether she could
borrow} my notes.}

\subsubsection{Reported wh- questions}
The \textbf{wh-} word is followed by normal word order (subject + verb).
The verb tense and other changes are the same as for other types of
reported speech:

\textit{``Why did you leave that job?'' She asked him \tox
She asked \textbf{him why he had left} that job.}

\subsection{Difference between review and report}
\subsubsection{Review}
A review is an unasked paragraph pointed to the customers of a local
or a object and is normally written with an informal language.

\subsubsection{Report}
Is generally an asked paragraph pointed to the manufactor of a product or the
owner of a local, and talks about the quality and what can be improved.

\subsection{Summary reports}
We can use some reporting verbs to summarize what was said:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{``Don't come back -- or else'' \tox They \textbf{threatened} us};
    \item \textit{``It was me. I did it'' \tox He \textbf{confessed}}.
\end{enumerate}

Some verbs, such as \textbf{speak}, \textbf{tell} and \textbf{thank}, are only used in summary
reports, not with direct or indirect speech:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{She \textbf{spoke} briefly to reporters.}
    \item \textit{I \textbf{talked} to Kevin about the problem and he \textbf{thanked} me.}
\end{enumerate}

We can use reporting verbs such as \textbf{boast} or \textbf{lie} + \textbf{about}
to create a summary report:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{He \textbf{boasted about} his win};
    \item \textit{He \textbf{lied about} how he did it}.
\end{enumerate}

Other verbs used like this include: \textbf{complain, explain, inquire,
joke, protest, speak, write}.


\newpage
\section{Conditionals}

\subsection{Conditional 0}
Conditional zero is used to express a fact, something that is always true.

In conditional zero we can use either ``\textbf{If}'' or ``\textbf{When}'' as preposition,
only if the probability is 100\%:
\figbox{If/When + Present simple \tox Present simple}

i.g.:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If demand for a product \textit{rises}, its price \textit{rises} too;
    \item When demand for a product \textit{rises}, its price \textit{rises} too.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Conditional 1}
Conditional 1 is used to express a present/future situation of highly probability. 

The highly probability is gived in the ``if'' clause, not in the ``consequence'' clause.
\figbox{If + Present simple \tox Future simple (\textit{will do})}

ig.:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If I \textit{see} her tomorrow, I \textit{will speak} to her;
    \item I \textit{will not let} them in if they \textit{are} late again.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Conditional 2}
Conditional 2 is used to express a present/future situation of low probability.

It is used to express a zero probability sentence (hypotesis).
\figbox{If + Past simple \tox would do}

i.g.:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If I \textit{saw} her tomorrow, I \textit{would speak} to her;
    \item If I \textit{had} some time, I \textit{would tidy up} my office.
\end{enumerate}

\wrn{The correct form of the verb ``\textbf{to be}'' in Conditional 2
is always ``\textbf{were}''.}

\subsection{Conditional 3}
Conditional 3 is used to express a past situation, when is too late to change
something or there are zero possibilities to change it.
\figbox{If + Past Perfect \textit{had done} \tox would have done}

i.g.:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If I \textit{had seen} her, I \textit{would have spoken} to her;
    \item I \textit{wouldn't hate let} them in if they \textit{had been} late.
\end{enumerate}

\newpage
\subsection{Special cases}
\subsubsection{Use of ``would'' for politeness}
If you follow me please, I'll show you your room.

\hspace*{3.6cm}$\downarrow$

If you \textit{would follow} me, I'll show you your room.

\subsubsection{Imperative and requests in Conditional 1}
If you see John, please give him this book.

\hspace*{3.6cm}$\downarrow$

\textit{Could} you give John this book please if you see him?

\subsubsection{Use of ``may, might, could''}
These can be used in the ``consequence'' clause to reduce the centainty
of the action in that clause:

\pph{Compare (Conditional 1)}
\wrn{``\textbf{may}'' is used only in Conditional 1 sentences.}

If I see her tomorrow, I will speak to her.

\hspace*{3cm}$\downarrow$

If I see her tomorrow, I \textit{may} speak to her.

\pph{Compare (Conditional 2)}
If they were late again, I would not let them in.

\hspace*{3.5cm}$\downarrow$

If they were late again, I \textit{might} not let them in.

\pph{Compare (Conditional 3)}
If I had had some time last week, I would have tidied up my office.



If I had had some time last week, I \textit{could} have tidied up my office.
