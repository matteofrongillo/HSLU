    "Supplementary note:\n",
    "\n",
    "The two probabilities $P(T^+|K)$ and $P(K|T^+)$ are highly relevant in the field of machine learning (ML) - a branch of artificial intelligence. ML often deals with decisions, so-called classifiers (here our test) for the automated distinction of a given set into different categories (here sick and healthy persons). The probability $P(T^+|K)$ denotes the so-called sensitivity (recall) and is a measure of the proportion of the category ($K$) - which should be detected by the classifier (here sick person) - that is actually recognized:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(T^+|K) = \\dfrac{P(T^+ \\cap K)}{P(K)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(K|T^+)$, on the other hand, is the so-called precision and indicates how large the proportion of correct detections $P(K \\cap T^+)$ within all detections of the classifier $(T^+)$ really is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(K|T^+) = \\dfrac{P(K \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitivity and relevance are mutually dependent and an increase in one value inevitably leads to a decrease in the other. Depending on the problem, a classifier with high sensitivity or high relevance is sought.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the medical test, we are looking for a high sensitivity (here $P(T^+|K)=0.95$) so that sick people are reliably detected. Although there are relatively many errors (relevance “only” $P(K|T^+) = 0.3242$), if the person is healthy - despite a positive test - this will quickly become apparent in the subsequent examinations. “Missing” a sick person and the outbreak of the disease would have much more serious consequences.\n",
    "- In contrast to this, we are looking for a high relevance e.g. in case of a SPAM filter. I.e. an email marked as SPAM - which is automatically sorted out - should be one with a probability close to certainty. Even if not all SPAM are recognized - i.e. sensitivity is not close to 100% - this is less serious, as we can usually recognize  a SPAM at first sight and simply delete it. However, if 80% or even 90% of SPAM emails are automatically pre-filtered, this is already a great help.\n"
